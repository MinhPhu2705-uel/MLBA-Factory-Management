  This dataset offers a rich view into the daily operations of a factory over a year and a half. It encompasses data for 508 workers, though the total number of individuals appearing reflects employee turnover (687). Daily recordings capture both routine occurrences, such as attendance and worker efficacy levels, alongside significant one-time events. These one-time events could include accidents, employee departures, or the introduction of new hires. By providing a comprehensive picture of both the everyday and the exceptional, this dataset allows for in-depth analysis of the factory's workforce dynamics and performance.  
  
#### Project overview
  This project focuses on managing the performance of 508 employees in a factory over 18 weeks (from 2021-01-01 to 2022-06-30). It includes working performance, health indicators, roles, etc., and aims to identify the relationships between these indicators and employees' efficacy and their likelihood of leaving the job. The system does not only manage the employee data but it also visualize charts presenting employee's performance and integrated ML model to cluster employee based on group related to key peformance indicators as well as predicting productivity in the future.
